Training
This document lists the quotas and limits that apply to Vertex AI.
A quota restricts how much of a particular shared Google Cloud resource your Google Cloud project can use, including hardware, software, and network components.
Quotas are part of a system that does the following:
Monitors your use or consumption of Google Cloud products and services.
Restricts your consumption of those resources for reasons including ensuring fairness and reducing spikes in usage.
Maintains configurations that automatically enforce prescribed restrictions.
Provides a means to make or request changes to the quota.
When a quota is exceeded, in most cases, the system immediately blocks access to the relevant Google resource, and the task that you're trying to perform fails. In most cases, quotas apply to each Google Cloud project and are shared across all applications and IP addresses that use that Google Cloud project.
To increase or decrease most quotas, use the Google Cloud console. For more information, see Request a higher quota limit.
There are also limits on Vertex AI resources. These limits are unrelated to the quota system. Limits cannot be changed unless otherwise stated.
Request quotas
The following quotas apply to Vertex AI requests for a given project and supported region. For example, in a single project, you can have up to 30,000 online prediction requests per minute in one region and another 30,000 online prediction requests per minute in another supported region.
Request quota Value
Resource management requests* per minute 600
Job or long-running operation requests per minute 60
Online prediction requests per minute+ 30,000
Online prediction request throughput per minute 1.5 GB
Online explanation requests per minute 600
Vertex AI Vizier requests per minute 6,000
Vertex AI Feature Store online serving requests per minute 300,000
Vertex ML Metadata requests per minute 12,000
* Resource management requests include any request that is not a job, long-running operation, online prediction request, or Vertex AI Vizier request.
+ This quota applies for public endpoints only. Private endpoints have unlimited requests per minute.
Jobs or long-running operations include the following requests:
Creating or deleting a dataset
Importing or exporting data to or from a dataset
Creating an endpoint
Creating or deleting a custom job
Creating or deleting a data labeling job
Creating or deleting a hyper parameter tuning job
Creating or deleting a batch prediction job
Creating or deleting a model
Uploading, deleting, or exporting a model
Creating or deleting a notebook runtime template
Assigning, deleting, starting, or upgrading a notebook runtime
AutoML model quotas
The following quotas apply to each data type and objective for a given project and region. For example, in a particular project and region, you can deploy 10 AutoML image classification models and 10 AutoML image object detection models for a total of 20 deployed models.

Vertex AI Feature Store
This section lists the quotas and limits for the following:
Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy)
Vertex AI Feature Store (preview)
Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy)
The following quotas apply to a given project and region. For example, in a single project, you can have 75 concurrent batch jobs in us-central1 and another 75 jobs in europe-west4.
Quota Value
Online serving requests per minute 300,000
Streaming ingestion requests per minute 60,000
Streaming ingestion write throughput per minute 1.2 GB
Feature creation requests per minute 100
Online serving nodes across all featurestores 30
Concurrent batch jobs (ingestion, serving, and delete feature values combined) 75
Concurrent requests to delete feature values 1
Entity types across all featurestores 75
Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) also has the following limits. You can't request an increase to any of the limits in the following table:
Limit Value
Storage limit for an online serving node 5 TB
Total data in the offline store Unlimited
Features per entity type 5,000
Number of create, update, and delete featurestore requests per day per project per region 500
For streaming ingestion, the size per request 1 MB
For streaming read, the number of entities that can be included per request 100
For batch import, the number of files that can be included per request 5,000 for Avro or 500 for CSV
For batch serving and exports, the number of features you can request 5,000
For batch ingestion and streaming ingestion, the oldest timestamp for which feature data can be ingested 4,000 days from current date
The data retention limit in Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) has the following default value, which you can override:
Data retention defaults Default value
Data retention in offline store (oldest feature value timestamp after which the values are deleted) 4,000 days from the current date
Data retention in online store (oldest feature value timestamp after which the values are deleted) 4,000 days from the current date
You can override the data retention limit in the following ways:
To override the data retention limit for the online store, set the online_storage_ttl_days parameter while creating or updating a featurestore.
To override the data retention limit for the offline store, set the offline_storage_ttl_days parameter while creating or updating an entity type.
Note: Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) uses column-partitioned tables from BigQuery. Your project can make up to 30,000 partition modifications per day for a column-partitioned table in BigQuery. If you exceed this limit, Vertex AI returns an error. For more information about this error, see Number of partition modifications for column-partitioned tables quota errors.
Learn more about limits for BigQuery partitioned tables.
