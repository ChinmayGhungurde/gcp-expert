Image generation
With the Image Generation feature of Vertex AI, you can generate novel images and edit images based on text prompts you provide, or edit only parts of images using a mask area you define along with a host of other capabilities.
Model Feature Description Input Output Price
Imagen Image generation Generate an image at 1024x1024 resolution Text prompt Image $0.020 per image
Image editing Edit an image at 1024x1024 resolution using mask free or mask approach Image/Text prompt Image $0.020 per image
Upscaling Increase resolution of a generated image to 2k and 4k Image Image $0.003 per image
Fine-tuning Enable a “subject” provided by the user to used in Imagen prompts (few shot training) Subject(s) with text identifier and 4-8 images per subject Fine-tuned model (after training with user provided subjects) $ per node hour (Vertex AI custom training pricing)
Visual Captioning Generate a short or long text caption for an image Image Text caption $0.0015/image
Visual Q&A Provide an answer based on a question referencing an image Image/Text prompt Text answer $0.0015/image
Embeddings for Multimodal: Text Generate embeddings using text as an input Text Embeddings $0.0002 / 1k characters input
Embeddings for Multimodal: Image Generate embeddings using image as an input Image Embeddings $0.0001 / image input
Text generation
Generative AI on Vertex AI charges by every 1,000 characters of input (prompt) and every 1,000 characters of output (response). Characters are counted by UTF-8 code points and white space is excluded from the count. During the Preview stage, charges are 100% discounted. Prediction requests that lead to filtered responses are charged for the input only. At the end of each billing cycle, fractions of one cent ($0.01) are rounded to one cent.
Note: Prediction pricing for tuned model endpoints are the same as for the base foundation model.

Example cost calculation
If a user sends five separate requests to the PaLM Text Bison model, and each request has a 200-character input and 400-character output, the total charge is calculated as follows:
Input cost:
200 input characters x 5 prompts = 1,000 total input characters;
1,000 total input characters x ($0.0005 / 1000) = $0.0005 input cost.

Output cost:
400 output characters x 5 prompts = 2,000 total output characters;
2,000 total output characters x ($0.0005 / 1000) = $0.001 output cost.

Total cost:
$0.0005 input cost + $0.001 output cost = $0.0015 total cost.
