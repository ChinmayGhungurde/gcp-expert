Stream response from chat model
What's next
Use Vertex AI to send a text chat prompt to Google's PaLM 2 Large Language Model (LLM) and to receive a response. Test and customize prompts to meet the needs of your application.
Before you begin
Before you can try the text chat prompts, you must do the following:
Set up a project and a development environment. The project ID is needed to run the sample code.
Familiarize yourself with the text chat parameters that you must replace before running the sample code.
Review the text chat use cases to help you identify which type of sample to create.

You can run the sample code in the Cloud Shell terminal in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Cloud Shell
Edit the placeholders in the sample code, and copy to the console.
