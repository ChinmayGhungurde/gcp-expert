What's next
To get audit logs about the usage of your model endpoints, you need to enable Data Access audit logs for Vertex AI. Data Access audit logs include "admin read" operations that read metadata or configuration information. They also include "data read" and "data write" operations that read or write user-provided data.
After you enable Data Access audit logs for Vertex AI, to view the data_access log stream in the Google Cloud console, you need to be granted the Private Logs Viewer role (roles/logging.privateLogViewer) .
To learn more about Data Access logs, including how to enable and view the logs, see Vertex AI audit logging information.
