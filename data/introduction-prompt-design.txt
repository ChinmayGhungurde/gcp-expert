General prompt design strategies
Give instructions
Include examples
Prompt design is the process of creating prompts that elicit the desired response from language models. Writing well structured prompts is an essential part of ensuring accurate, high quality responses from a language model. This page introduces some basic concepts, strategies, and best practices to get you started in designing prompts.
What is a prompt
A prompt is a natural language request submitted to a language model to receive a response back. Prompts can contain questions, instructions, contextual information, examples, and partial input for the model to complete or continue. After the model receives a prompt, depending on the type of model being used, it can generate text, embeddings, code, images, videos, music, and more.
Prompt content types
Prompts can include one or more of the following types of content:
Input (required)
Context (optional)
Examples (optional)
Input
An input is the text in the prompt that you want the model to provide a response for, and it's a required content type. Inputs can be a question that the model answers (question input), a task the model performs (task input), an entity the model operates on (entity input), or partial input that the model completes or continues (completion input).
Question input
A question input is a question that you ask the model that the model provides an answer to.
Prompt:
What's a good name for a flower shop that specializes in selling bouquets of
dried flowers?
  
Response:
* **Dried Blooms**
* **Floral Arrangements**
* **The Flower Shop**
* **A Touch of Nature**
* **Bouquets Galore**
* **The Perfect Bloom**
* **Scented Splendor**
* **Dried Flower Arrangements**
* **Preserved Petals**

Task input
A task input is a task that you want the model to perform. For example, you can tell the model to give you ideas or suggestions for something.
Prompt:
Give me a list of things that I should bring with me to a camping trip.
  
Response:
Tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, camping stove, cooking utensils, food, water, first aid kit, flashlight, lantern, matches or lighter, trash bags, map and compass, sunscreen, insect repellent, hat, sunglasses, and rain gear.
  
(text-bison@001)
Entity input
An entity input is what the model performs an action on, such as classify or summarize. This type of input can benefit from the inclusion of instructions.
Prompt:
Classify the following items as [large, small].
Elephant
Mouse
Snail
  
Response:
Elephant is large.
Mouse is small.
Snail is small.
  
(text-bison@001)
Completion input
A completion input is text that the model is expected to complete or continue.
Prompt:
Some strategies to overcome writer's block include
  
Response:
* **Freewriting.** This is a technique where you write whatever comes to mind, without stopping to think about grammar or spelling. This can help you to generate ideas and get your creative juices flowing.
* **Brainstorming.** This is a technique where you write down all of the ideas that come to mind, without judging them. Once you have a list of ideas, you can start to narrow them down and develop them further.
* **Mind mapping.** This is a technique where you draw a diagram of your ideas, connecting them with lines to show how they relate to each other. This can help you to visualize your ideas and see how they fit together.
* **Taking a break.** Sometimes, the best way to overcome writer's block is to take a break from writing and do something else for a while. This can help you to clear your head and come back to your writing with fresh eyes.
* **Getting help from others.** If you're struggling to overcome writer's block, don't be afraid to ask for help from others. You can talk to a friend, family member, or teacher, or you can seek professional help from a therapist or writing coach.

Context
Context can be one of the following:
Instructions that specify how the model should behave.
Information that the model uses or references to generate a response.
Add contextual information in your prompt when you need to give information to the model, or restrict the boundaries of the responses to only what's within the prompt.
Prompt:
Marbles:
Color: red
Number: 12
Color: blue
Number: 28
Color: yellow
Number: 15
Color: green
Number: 17

How many green marbles are there?
  
Response:
There are 17 green marbles.
  
(text-bison@001)
Examples
Examples are input-output pairs that you include in the prompt to give the model an example of an ideal response. Including examples in the prompt is an effective strategy for customizing the response format.
Prompt:
Classify the following.
Options:
- red wine
- white wine

Text: Chardonnay
The answer is: white wine
Text: Cabernet
The answer is: red wine
Text: Moscato
The answer is: white wine

Text: Riesling
The answer is:
  
Response:
white wine

General prompt design strategies
Prompt design enables users who are new to machine learning (ML) control model output with minimal overhead. By carefully crafting prompts, you can nudge the model to generate a desired result. Prompt design is an efficient way to experiment with adapting a language model for a specific use case.
Language models, especially large language models (LLM), are trained on vast amounts of text data to learn the patterns and relationships between words. When given some text (the prompt), language models can predict what is likely to come next, like a sophisticated autocompletion tool. Therefore, when designing prompts, consider the different factors that can influence what a model predicts comes next.
While there's no right or wrong way to design a prompt, there are common strategies that you can use to affect the model's responses. This section introduces you to some common prompt design strategies.
Give instructions
Giving the model instructions means telling the model what to do. This strategy can be an effective way to customize model behavior. Ensure that the instructions you give are clear and concise.
The following prompt provides a block of text and tells the model to summarize it:
Prompt:
Summarize this text.
Text: A quantum computer exploits quantum mechanical phenomena to perform
calculations exponentially faster than any modern traditional computer. At very
tiny scales, physical matter acts as both particles and as waves, and quantum
computing uses specialized hardware to leverage this behavior. The operating
principles of quantum devices is beyond the scope of classical physics. When
deployed at scale, quantum computers could be used in a wide variety of
applications such as: in cybersecurity to break existing encryption methods
while helping researchers create new ones, in meteorology to develop better
weather forecasting etc. However, the current state of the art quantum
computers are still largely experimental and impractical.
  
Response:
A quantum computer is a device that uses quantum mechanics to perform
calculations. It can perform calculations exponentially faster than any modern
traditional computer. Quantum computers use specialized hardware to leverage the
behavior of physical matter at very tiny scales. This behavior is beyond the
scope of classical physics. When deployed at scale, quantum computers could be
used in a wide variety of applications. These include cybersecurity,
meteorology, and drug discovery. However, the current state of the art quantum
computers are still largely experimental and impractical.
  
(text-bison@001)
The model provided a concise summary, but maybe you want the summary to be written in a way that's easier to understand. For example, the following prompt includes an instruction to write a summary that's simple enough for a fifth grader to understand:
Prompt:
Summarize this text. Write the summary so that a fifth grader can understand it.

Response:
A quantum computer is a new kind of computer that uses different rules than
regular computers. It can do some calculations much faster than regular
computers. Quantum computers are still being developed, but they could be used
for things like breaking codes and weather forecasting.
  
(text-bison@001)
The instruction to write the summary so a fifth grader can understand it resulted in a response that's easier to understand.
Summary:
Give the models instructions to customize its behavior.
Make each instruction clear and concise.
Include examples
You can include examples in the prompt that show the model what getting it right looks like. The model attempts to identify patterns and relationships from the examples and apply them to form a response. Prompts that contain a few examples are called few-shot prompts, while prompts that provide no examples are called zero-shot prompts. Few-shot prompts are often used to regulate the formatting, phrasing, scoping, or general patterning of model responses.
Zero-shot vs few-shot prompts
The following zero-shot prompt asks the model to choose the best explanation.
Prompt:
Please choose the best explanation to the question:

Question: How is snow formed?
Explanation1: Snow is formed when water vapor in the air freezes into ice crystals in the atmosphere, which can combine and grow into snowflakes as they fall through the atmosphere and accumulate on the ground.
Explanation2: Water vapor freezes into ice crystals forming snow.
Answer:
  
Response:
Explanation1
  
(text-bison@001)
If your use case requires the model to produce concise responses, you can include examples in the prompt that give preference to concise responses.
The following prompt provides two examples that show preference to the shorter explanations. In the response, you can see that the examples guided the model to choose the shorter explanation (Explanation2) as opposed to the longer explanation (Explanation1) like it did previously.
Prompt:
Please choose the best explanation to the question:

Question: Why is sky blue?
Explanation1: The sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering, which causes shorter blue wavelengths of light to be scattered more easily than longer red wavelengths, making the sky look blue.
Explanation2: Due to Rayleigh scattering effect.
Answer: Explanation2, because Explanation2 is shorter.

Question: What is the cause of earthquakes?
Explanation1: Sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust.
Explanation2: Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates suddenly slip or break apart, causing a release of energy that creates seismic waves that can shake the ground and cause damage.
Answer: Explanation1, because Explanation1 is shorter.

Question: How is snow formed?
Explanation1: Snow is formed when water vapor in the air freezes into ice crystals in the atmosphere, which can combine and grow into snowflakes as they fall through the atmosphere and accumulate on the ground.
Explanation2: Water vapor freezes into ice crystals forming snow.
Answer:
  
Response:
Explanation2

Find the optimal number of examples
You can experiment with the number of examples to provide in the prompt for the most desired results. Models like PaLM can often pick up on patterns using a few examples, though you may need to experiment with what number of examples lead to the desired results. For simpler models like BERT, you may need more examples. At the same time, if you include too many examples, the model may start to overfit the response to the examples.
Use examples to show patterns instead of antipatterns
Using examples to show the model a pattern to follow is more effective than using examples to show the model an antipattern to avoid.
⛔ Negative pattern:
Example
Don't end haikus with a question:
Haiku are fun
A short and simple poem
Don't you enjoy them?
  
✅ Positive pattern:
Example
Always end haikus with an assertion:
Haiku are fun
A short and simple poem
A joy to write
  
Summary:
Including prompt-response examples in the prompt helps the model learn how to respond.
Give the model examples of the patterns to follow instead of examples of patterns to avoid.
Experiment with the number of prompts to include. Depending on the model, too few examples are ineffective at changing model behavior. Too many examples cause the model to overfit.
Let the model complete partial input
Generative language models work like an advanced autocompletion tool. When you provide partial content, the model can provide the rest of the content or what it thinks is a continuation of that content as a response. When doing so, if you include any examples or context, the model can take those examples or context into account.
The following example provides a prompt with an instruction and an entity input:
Prompt:
For the given order, return a JSON object that has the fields cheeseburger, burger, fries, or drink, with the value being the quantity.

Order: A burger and a drink.
  
Response:
Sure, here is the JSON object that you requested:

```json
{
  "burger": 1,
  "drink": 1
}
```

I hope this is helpful!
  
(text-bison@001)
While the model did as prompted, writing out the instructions in natural language can sometimes be challenging. In this case, you can give an example and a response prefix and let the model complete it:
Prompt:
Valid fields are cheeseburger, hamburger, fries, and drink.
Order: Give me a cheeseburger and fries
Output: {"cheeseburger": 1, "fries": 1}

Order: I want two burgers, a drink, and waffles.
Output:
  
Response:
{"hamburger": 2, "drink": 1}
  
(text-bison@001)
Notice how "waffles" was excluded from the output because it wasn't listed in the context as a valid field.
Prompt the model to format its response
The completion strategy can also help format the response. The following example prompts the model to create an essay outline:
Prompt:
Create an outline for an essay about hummingbirds.
  
Response:
**Introduction**

Hummingbirds are the smallest birds in the world, and they are also one of the most fascinating. They are found in North and South America, and they are known for their long, thin beaks and their ability to fly at high speeds.

**Body**

Hummingbirds are made up of three main parts: the head, the body, and the tail. The head is small and round, and it contains the eyes, the beak, and the brain. The body is long and slender, and it contains the wings, the legs, and the heart. The tail is long and forked, and it helps the hummingbird to balance while it is flying.

Hummingbirds are also known for their coloration. They come in a variety of colors, including green, blue, red, and purple. Some hummingbirds are even able to change their color!

Hummingbirds are very active creatures. They spend most of their time flying, and they are also very good at hovering. Hummingbirds need to eat a lot of food in order to maintain their energy, and they often visit flowers to drink nectar.

**Conclusion**

Hummingbirds are amazing creatures. They are small, but they are also very powerful. They are beautiful, and they are very important to the ecosystem.

Summary:
If you give the model a partial input, the model completes that input based on any available examples or context in the prompt.
Having the model complete an input may sometimes be easier than describing the task in natural language.
Adding a partial answer to a prompt can guide the model to follow a desired pattern or format.
Add contextual information
You can include in the prompt instructions and information that the model needs to solve a problem instead of assuming that the model has all of the required information.
The following example asks the model to give troubleshooting guidance for a router:
Prompt:
What should I do to fix my disconnected wifi? The light on my Google Wifi router is yellow and blinking slowly.
  
Response:
There are a few things you can do to try to fix your disconnected WiFi when the light on your Google Wifi router is yellow and blinking slowly.

1. Check your internet connection. Make sure that your modem is turned on and that the cable is properly connected to the router. You can also try restarting your modem.
2. Check your WiFi connection. Make sure that your WiFi is turned on and that you are within range of your router. You can also try restarting your WiFi.
3. Move your router to a different location. Make sure that your router is not in a location where it is blocked by walls or other objects.
4. Update your router's firmware. You can update your router's firmware by going to the Google Wifi website and following the instructions.
5. Factory reset your router. If you are still having problems, you can factory reset your router. This will erase all of your settings and you will need to set it up again from scratch.

To factory reset your router, you will need to log into the Google Wifi app and go to the Settings menu. Then, select the Advanced tab and click on the Factory Reset button. You will need to confirm that you want to factory reset your router. Once the reset is complete, you will need to set it up again from scratch.

If you are still having problems after trying these steps, you can contact Google support for help.
  
(text-bison@001)
The response looks like generic troubleshooting information that's not specific to the router or the status of the LED indicator lights.
To customize the response for the specific router, you can add to the prompt the router's troubleshooting guide as context for it to refer to when providing a response.
Prompt:
Answer the question using the text below. Respond with only the text provided.
Question: What should I do to fix my disconnected wifi? The light on my Google Wifi router is yellow and blinking slowly.

Text:
Color: Slowly pulsing yellow
What it means: There is a network error.
What to do:
Check that the Ethernet cable is connected to both your router and your modem and both devices are turned on. You might need to unplug and plug in each device again.

Color: Fast blinking yellow
What it means: You are holding down the reset button and are factory resetting this device.
What to do:
If you keep holding down the reset button, after about 12 seconds, the light will turn solid yellow. Once it is solid yellow, let go of the factory reset button.

Color: Solid yellow
What it means: Router is factory resetting.
What to do:
This can take up to 10 minutes. When it's done, the device will reset itself and start pulsing white, letting you know it's ready for setup.
Image Solid red light Solid red Something is wrong. Critical failure. Factory reset the router. If the light stays red, contact Wifi customer support."
  
Response:
It seems like your Google Wifi router is having a network error. According to the text, you should check that the Ethernet cable is connected to both your router and your modem and both devices are turned on. You might need to unplug and plug in each device again.

Summary:
Include information (context) in the prompt that you want the model to use when generating a response.
Give the model instructions on what to do.
Add prefixes
A prefix is a word or phrase that you add to the prompt content that can serve several purposes, depending on where you put the prefix:
Input prefix: Adding a prefix to the input signals semantically meaningful parts of the input to the model. For example, the prefixes "English:" and "French:" demarcate two different languages.
Output prefix: Even though the output is generated by the model, you can add a prefix for the output in the prompt. The output prefix gives the model information about what's expected as a response. For example, the output prefix "JSON:" signals to the model that the output should be in JSON format.
Example prefix: In few-shot prompts, adding prefixes to the examples provide labels that the model can use when generating the output, which makes it easier to parse output content.
In the following example, "Text:" is the input prefix and "The answer is:" is the output prefix.
Prompt:
Classify the text as one of the following categories.
- large
- small
Text: Rhino
The answer is: large
Text: Mouse
The answer is: small
Text: Snail
The answer is: small
Text: Elephant
The answer is:
  
Response:
large

Experiment with different parameter values
Each call that you send to a model includes parameter values that control how the model generates a response. The model can generate different results for different parameter values. Experiment with different parameter values to get the best values for the task. The parameters available for different models may differ. The most common parameters are the following:
Max output tokens
Temperature
Top-K
Top-P
Max output tokens
Maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the response. A token is approximately four characters. 100 tokens correspond to roughly 60-80 words.
Specify a lower value for shorter responses and a higher value for longer responses.
Temperature
The temperature is used for sampling during response generation, which occurs when topP and topK are applied. Temperature controls the degree of randomness in token selection. Lower temperatures are good for prompts that require a more deterministic and less open-ended or creative response, while higher temperatures can lead to more diverse or creative results. A temperature of 0 is deterministic, meaning that the highest probability response is always selected.
For most use cases, try starting with a temperature of 0.2. If the model returns a response that's too generic, too short, or the model gives a fallback response, try increasing the temperature.
Top-K
Top-K changes how the model selects tokens for output. A top-K of 1 means the next selected token is the most probable among all tokens in the model's vocabulary (also called greedy decoding), while a top-K of 3 means that the next token is selected from among the three most probable tokens by using temperature.
For each token selection step, the top-K tokens with the highest probabilities are sampled. Then tokens are further filtered based on top-P with the final token selected using temperature sampling.
Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses. The default top-K is 40.
Top-P
Top-P changes how the model selects tokens for output. Tokens are selected from the most (see top-K) to least probable until the sum of their probabilities equals the top-P value. For example, if tokens A, B, and C have a probability of 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 and the top-P value is 0.5, then the model will select either A or B as the next token by using temperature and excludes C as a candidate.
Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses. The default top-P is 0.95.
Prompt iteration strategies
Prompt design is an iterative process that often requires a few iterations before you get the desired response consistently. This section provides guidance on some things you can try when iterating on your prompts.
Use different phrasing
Using different words or phrasing in your prompts often yield different responses from the model even though they all mean the same thing. If you're not getting the expected results from your prompt, try rephrasing it.
Version 1:
How do I bake a pie?

Version 2:
Suggest a recipe for a pie.

Version 3:
What's a good pie recipe?
  
Switch to an analogous task
If you can't get the model to follow your instructions for a task, try giving it instructions for an analogous task that achieves the same result.
This prompt tells the model to categorize a book by using predefined categories.
Prompt:
Which category does The Odyssey belong to:
- thriller
- sci-fi
- mythology
- biography
  
Response:
The answer: mythology

Explanations:

The Odyssey is an epic poem in ancient Greek literature. It is one of two major
ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. The Odyssey is an epic poem that
tells the story of Odysseus, a Greek hero who fought in the Trojan War and then
spent ten years trying to return home to Ithaca. The Odyssey is a work of
mythology.
  
(text-bison@001)
The response is correct, but the model didn't stay within the bounds of the options. You also want to model to just respond with one of the options instead of in a full sentence. In this case, you can rephrase the instructions as a multiple choice question and ask the model to choose an option.
Prompt:
Multiple choice problem: Which of the following options describes the book The Odyssey?
Options:
- thriller
- sci-fi
- mythology
- biography
  
Response:
The answer is: mythology
  
(text-bison@001)
Change the order of prompt content
The order of the content in the prompt can sometimes affect the response. Try changing the content order and see how that affects the response.
Version 1:
[examples]
[context]
[input]

Version 2:
[input]
[examples]
[context]

Version 3:
[examples]
[input]
[context]
Fallback responses
A fallback response is a response returned by the model when either the prompt or the response triggers a safety filter. An example of a fallback response is "I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model."
If the model responds with a fallback response, try increasing the temperature.
Things to avoid
Avoid relying on models to generate factual information.
Use with care on math and logic problems.
